<h2>ImaginarySoundscape</h2>
<p> For this section of the assignment I decided to find a poem that connected with me, I had the main intention of creating a soundscape about the life of a futuristic robot that transitions from its creation to destruction. However, I couldn’t find a poem that I felt would work. But then I found “The Life of a Flower” by Wini Jose. The poem is about a Flower which sprouts into the world and admires its surroundings but then slowly decays and dies. I personally felt as though this was the poem, I had been looking for all along. 
The soundscape is intended to make the listener to feel as though they are the flower, slowly moving through life. Surpassing foul weather conditions and the wildlife that surrounds it. 
When creating the soundscape, I knew I needed to clearly create the sounds of; the flower sprouting, the area in which it had sprouted into and its demise. For this I focused on using pads, percussion, keys, flutes and brass, all used in their fitting places. 
I knew when portraying the flower sprouting, I wanted it to have a slow build with small creaks and cracks which gave the impression of each petal slowly opening. The wildlife and rain are there to represent the nature surrounding the flower while the pads and other instruments represent the weather. Whilst adding in a marimba and piano to play soft childish melodies to present the delicacy of a flower.</p>

<h2>Synaethesia</h2>
<p> After being inspired by our guest speaker I was curious about trying out Synaesthesia for myself, I sat down and watched through the videos we were given and wrote down a list of how they made me feel and did this a few times. I made sure to focus on the colours and movement of what I was seeing while comparing them to noises that I thought I could create on FL20. 
I also asked a few of my friends how they felt whilst watching the clips, to see if they could help me pinpoint my ideas. And some agreed with my thoughts whilst, others gave me new ideas and ways to perceive the video. 
In terms of sounds I could use to portray my interpretation I felt as though pads and percussion would do the trick as the visuals had smooth movements. To replicate this, I gave all my instruments and synths a very wet reverb, a light flanger which was to give a bigger sense of spatial awareness and a phaser which softened it all nicely. 
I originally started making the project with tempo and order but then I realised that that’s not what the visuals made me feel, it’s easy to lay a slow orchestral piece over something that looks as simplistic as this but I wanted to give emotion and emphasis to the movements, changes in size and the colourings. So, I played the track over again multiple times and each time I’d layer a new instrument over the top of the last. Adding low and high pitches to add variation such as the colours being shown as well as to give more texture to the piece at hand.</p>

<h2>CollaborativeProject</h2>
<p> Being able to collaborate with another course was something I really enjoyed doing and would love to do again. I ended up working with Will and Steph to help add a soundtrack to their documentary. 
The main focus of their documentary was fashion, specifically in Cambridge. So, I wasn’t sure what kind of beat to make for them as this could’ve been a short fashion show in which they went around Cambridge checking out the different styles that the city has to offer. (This is what I originally assumed it would be)
However, whilst one day going out looking for opportunities to shoot, they came across the vintage shop ‘Fantasia’ and decided to focus their documentary on being about the store and its owner. 
I originally put a song together before I had seen the footage and I wasn’t entirely sure if I was happy with it, in the end I scrapped it as it didn’t properly fit into the theme of the project.
Will and Stephie showed me some clips they had taken on their camera and gave me the initial rundown of how the documentary was going to play out. So, with the knowledge I got from that I put together a relaxed Lo-Fi beat which could play over the video but then was informed the video was going to be roughly 7minuets long and my song was only around 3. 
I asked Will if there was any particular direction, he’d like the music to take and he asked me to add in some smooth jazz. So, after a few hours of listening to ‘Smooth Jazz’, I put together a track that could add onto the end of the track I had already made. Adding a transition that fluently switched the beat over. 
I then lightly mastered the entire beat and sent it off to get feedback from Will and Steph in which they were happy with the turnout.</p>
